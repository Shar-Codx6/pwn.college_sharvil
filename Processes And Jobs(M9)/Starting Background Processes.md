# Starting Background Processes
This challenge asks us to use the & command to run the process /challenge/run in background.
## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Yr7PCjIiax6MM3-d-YyNjwJkoZF.QX5QDO0wyM2EzNzEzW}`

```bash
hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$ /challenge/run &
[1] 161
hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$


Yay, you started me in the background! Because of that, this text will probably
overlap weirdly with the shell prompt, but you're used to that by now...

Anyways! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{Yr7PCjIiax6MM3-d-YyNjwJkoZF.QX5QDO0wyM2EzNzEzW}
