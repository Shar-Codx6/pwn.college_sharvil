# Printing Variables
The /challenge/run program will not, and cannot, give you the flag, but that's okay, because the flag has been put into the variable called "FLAG"! Just have your shell print it out!

You can accomplish this using a number of ways, but we'll start with echo. This command just prints stuff.
## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{k-j4JXkl0HY7exTNpSr95kn4B4b.QX3UTN0wyM2EzNzEzW}`

```bash
hacker@variables~printing-variables:~$ echo $FLAG
pwn.college{k-j4JXkl0HY7exTNpSr95kn4B4b.QX3UTN0wyM2EzNzEzW}
```
