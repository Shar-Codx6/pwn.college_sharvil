# Multi-word variables
In this level, you'll need to set the variable PWN to COLLEGE YEAH.
## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{MKuo4Har9ULvECzXvUVzwl0ZEsD.QXwYTN0wyM2EzNzEzW}`

```bash
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{MKuo4Har9ULvECzXvUVzwl0ZEsD.QXwYTN0wyM2EzNzEzW}
```
