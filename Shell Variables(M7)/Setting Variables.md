# Variables Setting Variables
To solve this level, you must set the PWN variable to the value COLLEGE. Be careful: both the names and values of variables are case-sensitive! PWN is not the same as pwn and COLLEGE is not the same as College.
## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{I35PIoF-DV71YYVSyhTW-_rxXJ6.QX5UTN0wyM2EzNzEzW}`

```bash
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{I35PIoF-DV71YYVSyhTW-_rxXJ6.QX5UTN0wyM2EzNzEzW}
```
