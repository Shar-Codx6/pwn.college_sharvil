# Matching with ?
Starting from your home directory, change your directory to /challenge, but use the ? character instead of c and l in the argument to cd! Once you're there, run /challenge/run for the flag!
## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Ma8fXGUI7KdPGtRtjAud5C7BW45.QXyIDO0wyM2EzNzEzW}`

```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /?ha??enge
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Ma8fXGUI7KdPGtRtjAud5C7BW45.QXyIDO0wyM2EzNzEzW}
```
