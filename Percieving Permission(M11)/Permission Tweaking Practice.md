# Permission Tweaking Practice
This challenge will ask you to change the permissions of the /challenge/pwn file in specific ways a few times in a row. If you get the permissions wrong, the game will reset and you can try again. If you get the permissions right eight times in a row, the challenge will let you chmod /flag to make it readable for yourself :-) Launch /challenge/run to get started!
## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{helloworld}`

```bash
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ /challenge/run

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod a+rwx /flag
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ /flag
/flag: line 1: pwn.college{ous_FcR81iVg-5Fr4229oZw74m_.QXwEjN0wyM2EzNzEzW}

## Incorrect tangents I went on
I was trying to add permission only in hacker user.
