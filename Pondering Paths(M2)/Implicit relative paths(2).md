# Implicit Relative Path
The challenge wants us to refer to implicit path using **.**. This is using the **/challenge** directory.

## My solve
First change the current directory to **/**. Then run **./challenge/run**. It will show that it is located in **/challenge** directory. Switch to that directory and then execute **./run**. 

```bash
cd /
./challenge/run
cd /challenge
./run
```

**Flag:** `pwn.college{kxlXVOM1LSiYOGKChX-ozqAm3VK.QXxUTN0wyM2EzNzEzW}`
