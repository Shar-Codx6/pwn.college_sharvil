# Sorting Data
In this challenge, there's a file at /challenge/flags.txt containing 100 fake flags, with the real flag mixed among them. When sorted alphabetically, the real flag will be at the end.
## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{QVk1f7f2MndOVkIklLWqI2S97HT.0FM0MDOxwyM2EzNzEzW}`

```bash
sort -u /challenge/flags.txt
