# Deleting Characters
There are some symbols in the flag like ^ and %. Use tr -d to delete the symbols and get the flag.
## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{I1Ggc7BR3NgkMdsllNmTrnYofLo.0FNxEzNxwyM2EzNzEzW}`

```bash
hacker@data~deleting-characters:~$ /challenge/run | tr -d ^%
Your character-stuffed flag:
pwn.college{I1Ggc7BR3NgkMdsllNmTrnYofLo.0FNxEzNxwyM2EzNzEzW}
```
