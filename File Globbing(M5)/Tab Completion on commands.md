# Tab Completion on commands
Tab completion is for more than files! You can also tab-complete commands. This level has a command that starts with pwncollege, and it'll give you the flag. Type pwncollege and hit the tab key to auto-complete it!

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wJVrvxTdUwE4r2mKVCBQo4itjVM.0VN0EzNxwyM2EzNzEzW}`

```bash
hacker@globbing~tab-completion-on-commands:~$ pwncollege-10521
Correct! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{wJVrvxTdUwE4r2mKVCBQo4itjVM.0VN0EzNxwyM2EzNzEzW}
```
