# Tab Completion
This challenge has copied the flag into /challenge/pwncollege, and you can freely cat that file. But you can't type the filename
## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{QJ0Xk70fG34urfmVf_P-4Q90wE3.0FN0EzNxwyM2EzNzEzW}`

```bash
hacker@globbing~tab-completion:~$ cat /challenge/pwncollegeâ€‹
pwn.college{QJ0Xk70fG34urfmVf_P-4Q90wE3.0FN0EzNxwyM2EzNzEzW}
```
